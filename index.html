            <h2>A Brewer</h2>
            <p>Since 2017, I co-founded a brewery located in Puebla, Mexico. The true reason behind that project is that, as a beer-lover living in Mexico I was not able to find any beer truly delicious as the ones in my homeland, Belgium. So there we are: we cannot find it so let's produce it and sell it to whoever wants to drink great belgian style beers. We define our brewery by its ethnical influences:</p>

            <blockquote cite="http://www.origen1537.com">Origen 1537 raises the fusion of two ancient cultures that is intertwined by the love of fine drinking and eating. This merger was first made in 1537, when the Viceroy of New Spain imported three Belgian brewers to establish the first brewery in Mexico. It is with this same intention that a group of young entrepreneurs founded Origen 1537, an innovative brewery that seeks to satisfy the taste, increasingly demanding, of the artisanal beer consumers, to complete their moments of conviviality when eating and drinking.</blockquote>

            <h2>An Entrepreneur-Minded</h2>
            <p>Still not having enough with what I am doing right now, I am already planning on implementing new online businesses in the next few months. The idea behind that is to generate <i>"passive"</i> businesses that would allow my wife and myself to dedicate more time to our real passion: traveling the world! We plan on different online platforms combining both her and my knowledge in order to propose new solutions to recurring, common problems in dental health and eating habits. We will will make sure you will stay posted of our coming projects.</p><br>
